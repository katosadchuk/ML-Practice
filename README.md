After taking a Foundations in Machine Learning course with Dr. Richard Souvenir, I've developed an interest in machine learning. I hope to make this my specialty so I spend my free time participating in Kaggle competitions. Under each folder, you'll find the training and testing datasets, as well as my python source code. 

*1. Sinkhole Kaggle Competition*
For the final homework assignment in Dr. Souvenir's class, everyone participated in a Kaggle competition which can be found here.
