After taking a Foundations in Machine Learning course with Dr. Richard Souvenir, I've developed an interest in machine learning. I hope to make this my specialty so I spend my free time participating in Kaggle competitions. Under each folder, you'll find the training and testing datasets, as well as my python source code.

### 1. Sinkhole Kaggle Competition 
For the final homework assignment in Dr. Souvenir's class, everyone participated in a Kaggle competition which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/temple-sinkhole-classification). I finished in 9th place (out of 18), but was only 0.7% away from the person in 3rd place. My overall accuracy was 88.28%.
