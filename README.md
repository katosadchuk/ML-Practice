Machine Learning Practice
After taking a Foundations in Machine Learning course with Dr. Richard Souvenir, I've developed an interest in machine learning. I hope to make this my specialty so I spend my free time participating in Kaggle competitions. Under each folder, you'll find the training and testing datasets, as well as my python source code.

1. Sinkhole Kaggle Competition 
For the final homework assignment in Dr. Souvenir's class, everyone participated in a Kaggle competition which can be found here.
